The audio design in Merge Fruit adds perfectly for the gameplay, with playful melodies and sound effects that are satisfied with each combination. This hearing feedback creates another interesting layer, making each game useful.The audio design in Merge Fruit adds perfectly for the gameplay, with playful melodies and sound effects that are satisfied with each combination.

Awesome list, Chris! Thanks for putting this together. It's great to see so many quality projects and resources in one place.

Speaking of cool open-source projects, I recently came across a really well-made puzzle game that's perfect for a quick mental break from coding. It's called Enhanced Queens Game.

It's a clever take on the classic Queens logic puzzle, but with some unique new rules like colored regions that add a surprising amount of strategic depth. The UI is super clean, and it's built with Next.js/React.

If anyone is looking for a new brain-teaser, you can check it out here: Enhanced Queens Game.

Cheers!
